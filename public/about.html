<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Indian entrepreneur with a passion for finance and technology. Alongside my FX trading endeavors, I am also an aspiring full-stack developer, programmer, and amateur writer. At the age of 19, hailing from the beautiful state of Kerala, I embarked on this journey. Presently, I am an international student at the University of Northern British Columbia, pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
