<h1>The Best Movies As per Ashwin</h1>
<h2>Some movies from my favorite list.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>The best ever theater experience I had and my first IMAX experience. Mr. Nolan is in fact one among the G.O.A.T in Global Motion Picture history. <br>
    It's not only just about technical/cinematic elements of a movie, but also the narration elevates the whole craft, especially if it's a historical stuff.

<h3>Dark Knight Trilogy</h3>
<p>Apart from "Batman" stuffs, it got something more which I'm gonna tell as you had watched it already. If not GO WATCH IT DUDE!!.</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
